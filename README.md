## Description
This repository houses the program of a _**Express Note Taker**_ which was created using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and the [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer?activeTab=readme) dependency, as well as being deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). The program is a simple note taker app which allows a user to customize and save their notes, revisit saved notes, and delete notes.
